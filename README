# Crochet, Corner-to-Corner Basics

## Stitch Guide
ch: chain
dc: double crochet (smaller-scale, mini designs use hdc, half double crochet)
sl-st: slip stitch
ch-3-sp: chain 3 space
yarn: worsted weight
hook: H-8 (5.0 mm)

## Rounds
R1:
- Chain 6.
- Dc in the 4th chain from the hook.
- Dc in each of the two remaining chains.
Pixel block of the ch-3 turning chain and 3 dc stitches.

R2:
- Turn
- Chain 6
- Dc in the 4th chain from the hook.
- Dc in each of the two remaining chains.
- Join to previous tile.Slip stich into ch3-sp from previous row
- Make next tile (chain 3. make 3dc into same ch-3-sp)

R3:
- Turn
- Ch 6. DC in the 4th chain from the hook, and in each of the 2 remaining chains. (1 tile complete.)
- Sl st into the ch-3-sp from the previous row. Ch 3, 3 dc into the same ch-3-sp. (2nd tile complete.)
- Sl st into the ch-3 sp from the previous row. Ch 3, 3 dc into the same ch-3-sp. (3rd tile complete.)

Continue increasing, finishing on the middle
middle row == top right corner

First Decrease Row
- Slip stitch in each dc across, and slip stitch into the ch-3-space.
- Chain 3, and work 3 dc into the ch-3-sp of the previous row. (This completes the first tile of this row.)
- Last tile of the row: Work the last tile of the row, and slip stitch into the next ch-3-space. Don’t chain 3 to start a new tile – instead, turn your work to start the next decrease row.

Last row/tile
- Slip stitch in each dc across, and slip stitch into the ch-3-space.
- Ch 3, and work 3 dc into the ch-3-sp of the previous row. (This completes the first tile of this row.)
